The most efficient way to level a skill is (contrary to Reddit's opinion) is entirely up to you. Again, some methods are more engaging (read: sweaty) and others can be done from your phone while at the Doctor's office.

# Skilling Activities
OS is shifting towards a "social skilling game," which just means there's big minigames you can play on dedicated [worlds](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Server). Some are bosses, some are contract work, most are just alternative ways to train a skill.
