# Minigames and Activities

Traditional skilling is going out of fashion. Below are all the minigames and other activies you can do to skill and not lose your mind.

> **Drop-Training** is when you gather a resource just to drop your whole inventory and do it again.

> **Tabable** is an activity you can start and do something else, then repeat.

## Skilling Bosses

| Boss name  |           Skills Trained            | Difficulty |                                    Requirements                                     |
| :--------: | :---------------------------------: | :--------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Tempoross  |   Fishing, Cooking, Construction    |    Easy    |                                   Lvl 15 Fishing                                    |
| Wintertodt | Firemaking, Fletching, Construction |    Easy    |                                    Warm Clothes                                     |
|  Zalcano   |   Mining, Smithing, Runecrafting    |   Medium   | Completed [Song of the Elves](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Song_of_the_Elves) |
|  Hespori   |           Farming, Combat           |   Medium   |         Lvl 65 Farming, Med Combat Stats, Overhead [Prayers](./Prayers.md)          |

**Tempoross** and **Wintertodt** are similar. They both require you to collect a resource, prepair it in some way, and damage the boss with it. Both can be solo'd for more rewards, or conquored on a mass world for faster XP.

**Tempoross** is the easiest to start, learn, and it deals no damage.

**Wintertodt** is easy to learn, but gathering the warm clothing will take about half an our. It also deals damage and requires a lot more attention than **Tempoross**.

**Zalcano** is more of a boss fight, but the only damage dealt can be done by skilling. Way more mechanics than previous 2, but similar in the sense you gather resource to damage the boss. Huge barrier of entry, with the SotE quest.

**Hespori** is a regular boss fight. It has a few phases that you gotta learn, but it's easy with medium combat stats.

## Skilling Activities

Skilling activities involve a very simple game loop that you do in with other players, usually on a dedicated world.

## Notable Minigames

Sadly, a lot of the PVP minigames have been overran by bots and are only played by bots. Any dead content that isn't played is omitted from my summary.
