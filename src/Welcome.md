# Welcome to Oldschool RuneScape! ⚔️

*I'm sad to inform you that this is the last game you'll ever truly play.*

## What is OSRS?
OSRS is a MMORPG set in the world of **Gielinor**. It's a point-and-click game that involves you joining in various **game-loops** to gain **experience** towards **skills**.

Some loops are more AFK and offer lower amounts of experience, while others are more intensive and more rewarding.

## Why are there 2 RuneScapes?
The original game you played as a kid is still going on today. It's the base game, also known as **RS3**. RS3 is a clusterfuck, with a totally different combat system (as well as many, many pay to win microtransactions).

OldSchool is what you remember playing as a kid. It was launched in 20XX in an attempt to get old players back in with some nostalgia. Oldschool has surpassed RS3 in player count and is evolving with every week.

> Fun fact! A single membership covers both games, so if you'd like to try RS3 you can with the same account details. (You don't wan to)

## There's no better time to start
- The game has never been more accessible. The game isn't nearly as grindy, with lots of "skilling bosses" added to make skilling more engaging.
- The mobile client JUST got a face lift, bringing a suite of QoL improvements.
- It seems Jagex is leaning towards making the game more laidback, with ever growing QoL tweaks.

That being said, it's still RuneScape. Your entire experience is grinding out subgoals to help make your bigger goals a little easier. Nearly everything is locked behind a requirement, from transportation to spells to items. Shockingly, this makes the game way more rewarding.
