# RuneLite

RuneLite is an open source client to play RuneScape on. The original client was written in Java, but is now being rewritten in C# the mean time. This new official client is often referred to the "Steam Client," and borrows a lot from RuneLite.

## Is RuneLite safe?
If downloaded from the official site, yes. There's a lot of spoof clients out there that will steal your login, so be wary.

## What does RuneLite do?
It adds lots of custom plugins that really enhance the game. From allowing your GPU to render the game to swapping the position of menu items, there's a lot to learn. You'll learn all about them as you play the game, so I suggest ignoring them for now and toggling on what you need as you play the game.

## 3rd Party Plugins
There are a lot of amazing (and safe) communit plugins that can be installed in the client. **Do not install plugins from the web**. Only use the in-client 3rd party plugin hub.

## What 3rd Party Plugins should I use?
- [Quest Helper](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/quest-helper) is mandatory to having fun. It's a hand holder that tells you what to do in a quest.
- If you're into HD graphics, check out [117's HD plugin](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/117hd).

Again, unless you think a plugin could enchance something your'e learning about, just leave them alone. It's easy to bloat the client.
