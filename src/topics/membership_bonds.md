# Membership and bonds

## Should I buy membership?
If you have any interest in the game, I would go ahead and buy 1 month of membership. The full game is considerably more engaging than the free-to-play version, with faster experience and more activities.

## What are bonds?
Bonds are 14 days of membership that you can buy off the GE, or with IRL $. They serve two purposes.

1. Allow players to buy bonds with $ and sell in-game for gold
2. Allow players to spend gold for 14 days of membership.
   1. Bonds can also be traded/used on other accounts

## Are bonds worth saving for in free-to-play?
Some people are of the mentality "I can play free-to-play long enough, I can afford membership without spending a single dollar." It's about as realistic as digging a hole to China. Your entire free-to-play experience would be boring money making methods and would take months.

That being said, you don't have to pay for membership forever. It's possible to grind your account to a point where you can make enough gp/hour to cover 2 bonds a month. Some players even just play one main account and bond out their others. 

## Are bonds worth buying with IRL money for GP?
Ehh. A bond costs $7.99 and is worth ~5m-7m gold. It's a nice cash infusion everyone once and awhile, but you'll really have to be shilling out cash to play the game solely off bonds.

> Whales exist, and will mention buying a ton of bonds. Laugh at them, they are nerds 🐋
