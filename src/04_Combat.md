# Combat
There are 6 combat skills. **Attack**, **Strength**, **Defense**, **Hit Points**, **Ranged** and **Magic**.

They help build the 3 combat styles: Melee, Ranged, and Magic. You level these skills by using them in combat.

## How Combat works in OS
In OS, the game runs on "ticks." Every game tick progresses the game forward, and all events occur on a tick. Each tick is 0.6s. 

The [Rune Scimitar](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Rune_scimitar), for example, has a speed of 4. This means it hits every 2.4s (0.6 * 4).

- If you inflict damage, a bright red hitsplat will appear over the monster you attacked. This is how much damage you inflicted.
- Damage is calculated just before an attack animation occurs. NOT WHEN THE HITSPLAT APPEARS.
  - This is the core mechanic behind lazy prayer-flicking. You activate an overhead Prayer just before they attack and deactivate it right after they strike. This way, you have a chance of negating the damage and not drain any prayer points. Prayers are covered more in the next section.
- If you miss, a bright blue 0 hitsplat will appear.
- If any hitsplat is duller in appearance, this is someone else's attack.


## Combat skills explained (again)
|  Skill   | How it effects gameplay                                                                                    |
| :------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  Attack  | Determines your accuracy, or if your hit will land.                                                        |
| Strength | Determines how hard you hit if successful, and directly increases your melee max hit.                      |
| Defense  | Determines how much of a landing melee attack is negated.                                                  |
|    HP    | Determines how many hit points you have                                                                    |
|  Ranged  | Determines the max hit and accuracy of ranged attacks. Your ranged max hit is also influenced by strength. |
|  Magic   | Determines the max hit and accuracy of magic attacks.                                                      |

*On top of effecting your accuracy and max hits, higher levels allow you to use more powerful weapons or spells.*

## What order should I max the melee skills?
Because strength increases your max it, it's most efficient to max it first.
With that in mind, you do need higher Attack to equip better weapons.

Leveling any combat is a slow, long-haul skill. Don't expect any combat skill maxed for a long time.

## How do I train combat?
As soon as you can, complete the [Waterfall Quest](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Waterfall_Quest).

This will boost your Strength and Attack levels to 30+, a huge jump with little to no actual combat. As outlined in the [Quests](./03_Quests.md) section, quest rewards are most beneficial early in your accounts lifetime. 

## Combat Triangle

This is combat triangle. I literally don't think about it. I might be bad, but idk figured I'd mention it.

I typically equip gear that protects againt my opponent's damage type and a weapon that they're weak to.

Always check the wiki to see what kind of stats you're up against.
