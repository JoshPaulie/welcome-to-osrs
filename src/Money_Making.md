# Money Making
Money Making is a huge part of the game.

Most skills can be made profitable. For example, it may be faster (xp) to cut gems for crafting, but you also make jewelry and turn a profit.

Money making is a complex topic. It can be tackled in a couple different ways.

## Skilling
Do slower XP methods for something you can make money on (or at least break even).

## Slayer/PvM
Many of the big ticket items are dropped are by Slayer only monsters and bosses.

Some good money makers like Giant Mole or Barrows however are not locked behind a slayer level.

## PvP
Player V Player is a winner-takes-most battle to the death. It's nearly impossible to do on a low level account, so this method is not feasible.
