# Quests
Quests are great. Some people hate them, but they're pretty cute. The cutscenes are fun and dialog is usually witty.

Without the [Quest Helper](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/quest-helper) plugin for RuneLite, you will need to depend on the wiki to help you through quests. **Do not try to raw-dog quests.** It's a tremendous waste of time and the quests are not intuitive enough for you to brute force.
