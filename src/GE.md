# Grand Exchange (GE)
This is the auction house. You can sell and buy most items, with a 1% tax for sellers.

You will spend a lot of your time at the GE. Some skills are considered "Buyable Skills." This just means you buy the supplies you need (like mixing potions or carving arrows) to level skills like Crafting, Fletching, Magic, Herblore, etc.

Other skills are quite profitable, like Slayer. You'll use these skills to fund your buyable, making the game go by quicker. Buyable Skills are great for watching movies or YouTube.
